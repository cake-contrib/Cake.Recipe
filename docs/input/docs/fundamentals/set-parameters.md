Title: SetParameters Method
Description: Override the parameter values used by Cake.Recipe
---

Cake.Recipe is very customizable, in terms of how builds are executed, where files are stored, what notifications should be sent out, etc.  All of this customization is done through the SetParameters method, which gives you fine grain control over all aspects of Cake.Recipe.

As an example, you could do something like the following to override a number of the default parameter values (this example is taken from the Chocolatey GUI build):

```csharp
BuildParameters.SetParameters(context: Context,
                            buildSystem: BuildSystem,
                            sourceDirectoryPath: "./Source",
                            solutionFilePath: "./Source/ChocolateyGui.sln",
                            resharperSettingsFileName: "ChocolateyGui.sln.DotSettings",
                            title: "Chocolatey GUI",
                            repositoryOwner: "chocolatey",
                            repositoryName: "ChocolateyGUI",
                            appVeyorAccountName: "chocolatey",
                            appVeyorProjectSlug: "chocolateygui",
                            shouldDownloadFullReleaseNotes: true,
                            shouldDownloadMilestoneReleaseNotes: true,
                            shouldPublishChocolatey: false,
                            shouldPublishNuGet: false,
                            shouldPublishGitHub: false,
                            shouldCalculateVersion: true,
                            webLinkRoot: "ChocolateyGUI",
                            webBaseEditUrl: "https://github.com/chocolatey/ChocolateyGUI/tree/develop/docs/input/");
```

## Required Parameters

The SetParameters method has four input parameters which have to be provided, with the remainder being optional parameters that have default values.  The following is a list of the values that have to be provided.

### context

This is the current CakeContext, which can be provided directly as `Context`.

Type: `ICakeContext`

### buildSystem

This again if provided directly from Cake, and can be passed directly as `BuildSystem`.

Type: `BuildSystem`

### sourceDirectoryPath

This is the path to the directory where your source code files are stored.  Cake.Recipe is convention driven, and expects all the source files to be located in a folder like `./Source` or `./src` or similar.

Type: `DirectoryPath`

### title

This a essentially the name of the application that is being built within the repository.  For example, `Cake.Gem`, or `ChocolateyGUI`.  A number of the optional parameters will attempt to be derived from what you pass as the Title for your project, so depending on how you have named it, you might have to provide a value for some other parameters.

Type: `string`

## Optional Parameters

The SetParameters method uses the concept of optional parameters, in fact, all but four of the parameters to the SetParameters method are optional. To override a specific parameter, you need to use a named parameter. The following is a list of all the named parameters that can be used on the method.

### solutionFilePath

Cake.Recipe assumes that it is only building a single .Net solution file, and it needs to know the location of it.  It will attempt to form that location using the SourceDirectoryPath and the Title that are passed into SetParameters.

Type: `FilePath`

Default Value:

```csharp
SourceDirectoryPath.CombineWithFilePath(Title + ".sln")
```

### rootDirectoryPath
