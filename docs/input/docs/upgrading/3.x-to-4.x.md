Description: Changes and suggestions needed for porting from Cake.Recipe 3.x to 4.x

## Required Changes

### Switch to using Cake 2.3.0

Cake.Recipe is now using 2.3.0 of Cake, and as such, we recommend that any build using Cake.Recipe also targets using 2.3.0 of Cake.  We recommend that you follow the [upgrade instructions for Cake itself](https://cakebuild.net/docs/getting-started/upgrade#cake-1.x-to-cake-2.0), to ensure that there aren't any additional changes that you would need to make.

### Ensure correct Cake.Issues.Recipe usage

In this release of Cake.Recipe we have upgraded to 2.0.0 of Cake.Issues.Recipe. If in your build scripts you have extended the built in usage of Cake.Issues.Recipe you may need to check the release notes to confirm if there are any additional changes that need to be made.

[Check out the blog post here for additional information](https://cakeissues.net/news/cake-issues-v2.0.0-released).

### Codecov Coverage Uploads

In this release of Cake.Recipe we have updated the support for Codecov to now
require a token to be specified. If in your build scripts you have Codecov
enabled by default, you will see this task being skipped if you have not already
specified a token.

[Check out Codecov documentation for adding a token](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/adding-the-codecov-token)
