Title: Documentation
---
<p>This user guide, like Cake.Recipe itself, is under very active development. Some parts of it aren't 
documented as completely as they need to be, but we glady accept your contributions.</p>

<p>We need your help to improve the documentation for Cake.Recipe, so if there is something that you 
would like to add then you can edit the content directly on GitHub.</p>

@foreach(IDocument child in Model.DocumentList(Keys.Children).OrderBy(x => x.Get<int>(DocsKeys.Order, 1000)))
{
    <h1>@(child.String(Keys.Title))</h1>
    if(child.ContainsKey(DocsKeys.Description))
    {
        <p>@Html.Raw(child.String(DocsKeys.Description))</p>
    }

    @Html.Partial("_ChildPages", child)
}
