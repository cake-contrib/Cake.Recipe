    <Description>
    This NuGet package contains a set of re-usable scripts that can be added to your build using the load preprocessor directive.  As a result, it is possible to use the same set of build scripts across multiple projects, without having to duplicate the scripts.  All that is required is a small recipe build script, which sets the project specific information.  More information can be found about this project on the documentation page here:

https://cake-contrib.github.io/Cake.Recipe/docs/

NOTE:  Currently, Cake.Recipe itself is built using 0.38.4, and as a result, there is an expectation that that any project that is built using Cake.Recipe should also use 0.38.4 of Cake.  Using a newer version of Cake may work, but there is no guarantee that it will.
